      <h3 class="gameInfo" >Information about Valorant </h3>
      <p class="info" >Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter game developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First marketed under the code name Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game began in 2014. Valorant draws inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, who borrow various mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns and inaccuracies in motion. </p>
      <p class="info"> Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter that takes place in the near future. Players play as one of a cast of agents, characters drawn from multiple countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with five players on each team. Agents have unique abilities, each of which require charges, as well as a unique ult that requires charge through kills, kills, orbs, or targets. Each player begins each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "exclusive ability" charges. Other weapons and ability loadouts can be purchased using an in-game financial system that rewards money based on the result of the previous round, all kills the player is responsible for, and all goals achieved. The game has a variety of weapons including secondary weapons such as sidearms and primary weapons such as machine guns, shotguns, machine guns, automatic rifles, and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons, each with a unique firing pattern that must be controlled by the player in order to fire accurately.[7] It currently offers 18 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sleep, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, and Neon.
